#PREMISE

For a sample social graph of 10k to 10MM (or more, I just ran out of ram on my laptop) with an average of each user having 50 friends. Take two arbitrary users in the graph and determine if they are connected within 4 hops. Are they friends-of-friend-of-friends-of-friends. 

#Expected Size on Disk with Properties
10k Nodes / 50k Rels - 8mb
1MM Nodes / 50MM Rels - 4G
10MM Nodes / 500MM Rels - 40G
1BN Nodes / 500MM Rels - 400G
