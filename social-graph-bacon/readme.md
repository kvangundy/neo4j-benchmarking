#PREMISE

For a sample social graph of 10k to 10MM (or more, I just ran out of ram on my laptop) with an average of each user having 50 friends. Take two arbitrary users in the graph and determine if they are connected within 4 hops. Are they friends-of-friend-of-friends-of-friends. Or roughly 16-32 joins including recursive joins.
